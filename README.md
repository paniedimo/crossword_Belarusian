# crossword_Belarusian

This is my complete programming project, where I developed an algorithm for generating crossword puzzles using Belarusian vocabulary. It allows to fill large crossword grids with words automatically and semi-automatically. The code is quite extensive to overcome the incompleteness of vocabulary available online. The algorithm is constantly optimised and revised. Therefore, the currently posted version may not work right away. Please contact me if needed!

This project has a tremendous cultral value, as it is educational in a field of Belarusian language, which is underrepresented in world and even in Belarus.
